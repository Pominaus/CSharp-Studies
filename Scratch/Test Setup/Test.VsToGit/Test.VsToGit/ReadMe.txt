VerboseHello.exe

An intentionally verbose Hello World program to get the hang of Visual studio a bit and commit to github to test that side of things. 
I wanted to practice some of the keywords I've been studying and also form soemthing of a template to future projects/a refersher. 
Not a serious Hello World program.
